									The major and important objective of Chetana Home Based Care Centre in regard to Care and Support program is to prevent the spreading of HIV among the High Risk and general population.
								
								</p>
								<p>
									Awareness Programs : Awareness programs through informative session, door to door interaction, counselling and street play are the various methods used to teach and convince the people of HIV transmission.
								</p>
								<p>
									High Risk Area Development Activities : We too introduced a new way of keeping ourselves connected to the high risk areas in our locality. We conducted community meetings and formed Area Development Committee to plan and organize the activities for the improvement and development of their area. We have two gatherings in a month where by the Area development Committee would identify the issues which need to be dealt with and make solutions. We sensitize, motivate and support them technically in identifying the unhealthy practices or issues and in solving it under their leadership. The various activities we conducted were the supplementary education, no to alcohol and gambling, soak pits, plantation of trees, healthy food habits, gathering for strong family and community bond and promise to keep oneself away from unhealthy practices etc
